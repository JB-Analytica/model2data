## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added
- DBML `Enum` block support: `Enum <name> { ... }` blocks are parsed, and columns typed with an enum's name generate values only from that enum's set and get an `accepted_values` dbt schema test.
- Table and column `Note` text (both `Note: '...'` and multi-line `Note { ... }` forms) is now captured as `TableDef.description` / `ColumnDef.description` and rendered as `description:` fields in the generated dbt YAML, instead of being silently dropped or requiring the note to be JSON. The existing JSON `{"min": ..., "max": ...}` note convention keeps working exactly as before.
- Composite primary/unique keys declared in a table's `indexes { }` block (e.g. `(a, b) [pk]`) are now parsed into `TableDef.composite_keys`, deduplicated in generated seed data via bounded retry, and get a singular dbt SQL test under `tests/` that fails on any duplicate combination.
- `default:` column settings are now parsed into a typed `ColumnDef.default` (string/int/float/bool; backtick SQL expressions like `` `now()` `` are safely ignored). Nullable columns with a parsed default now fill "empty" rows with that default instead of `None`, mirroring real database behavior.
- `--unit-tests` CLI flag: opt-in generation of deterministic dbt unit test fixtures (`tests/unit/test_stg_<table>.yml`) built from a sample of the actually-generated seed rows. Requires dbt-core >= 1.8 to run; off by default since this project only requires `dbt-core>=1.5.0`.
- Many-to-many (`<>`) refs are no longer silently discarded during parsing; they're captured separately (`model2data.parse.dbml.get_many_to_many_refs()`) while remaining excluded from FK-based generation, as before.
- `examples/advanced_features.dbml` now also demonstrates an `Enum`-typed column and a composite unique key via `indexes { }`.

### Fixed
- Plain-text column notes (the normal DBML idiom, e.g. `note: 'the primary email address'`) are no longer discarded just because they aren't JSON.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Postgres output adapter: `model2data --adapter postgres` (requires `pip install "model2data[postgres]"`). Connection details are read from `MODEL2DATA_PG_HOST`, `MODEL2DATA_PG_PORT`, `MODEL2DATA_PG_USER`, `MODEL2DATA_PG_PASSWORD`, and `MODEL2DATA_PG_DATABASE`, with local-dev-friendly defaults.
- Name-aware synthetic data: untyped/string columns are now matched against ~35 common column-name patterns (`email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone`, `city`, `country`, `company`, `url`, ...) and filled with realistic Faker output instead of generic placeholder text.
- Post-run generation summary: after each run, the CLI prints tables generated, total rows, relationships found in the DBML, and any columns that fell back to generic text (with column name and type), so gaps in coverage are visible immediately instead of silently producing weak data.
- CI now runs a Postgres integration job: it generates a project with `--adapter postgres` against a live `postgres:16` service container and runs `dbt seed && dbt run` end-to-end.

### Fixed
- **Generated projects no longer break `dbt run` when installed via pip.** The dbt schema-naming macro was copied into new projects using a path relative to the current working directory, so it silently copied nothing unless model2data happened to be run from inside its own source checkout — every real installation hit a `Catalog Error: Table ... does not exist!` on the very first `dbt run`. The macro is now located relative to the installed package.
- The DBML parser no longer mis-parses multi-line `Note { ... }` blocks inside a table as a spurious column named `Note` with data type `{`. This affected the bundled `examples/hackernews.dbml`, among other schemas using this note syntax.
- Every command in `README.md` and `examples/README.md` used a `model2data generate --file ...` form that the CLI has never accepted (`Got unexpected extra argument (generate)`); all examples are corrected to `model2data --file ...`.
